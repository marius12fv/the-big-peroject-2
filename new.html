              <h2 class="base">Why is important to playing Baseball?</h2>
              <p>America’s favorite pastime BASEBALL is still the leading youth sport among teens across the United States.
                 Baseball is a great way to teach them the value of teamwork. Not to mention, it is a great way to stay healthy and physically fit when played on a regular basis.
                  The cardio exercise strengthens your heart muscle and improves lung capacity, which you get from running around the field. Batters running the bases,
                   outfielders running to catch a fly ball and catchers chasing a foul ball all get short bursts of cardiovascular exercise.</p>

            <img class="lebron" alt="LeBron playing basketball" src="NEWCSS/17047817405220.jpg" >

                <figcaption class="container">Yes, the man many fans (ignorantly) consider the most overrated choke artist in the league is actually the best player to ever set foot on a court.
                     LeBron James just does things that shouldn’t be humanly possible.
                     He’s bigger than a good portion of the players in the NFL and yet he still moves as gracefully as the most nimble guards in basketball.
                     Moreover, he not only faced the incredible pressure of being anointed “The Chosen One” by Sports Illustrated as a teenager, but he’s actually exceeded the lofty expectations set for him.
                     As magnificent as earlier players were, they never had to deal with the 24/7 stresses of 21st century media, which James has with aplomb. 
                     Through the publication of this list, James has averaged a Robertson-esque 27.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 6.9 steals per game and—unlike the Big O—he was doing so against teams stocked with elite athletes and not players who smoked cigarettes at halftime. 
                     When people knocked him for not winning championships early in his career, they overlooked that he almost single-handedly took an overmatched Cleveland Cavaliers squad to the 2007 NBA finals at just 22 years old. And, of course, he’s since won two titles (and counting?) as a member of the Miami Heat.
                     Not only does he routinely pull off feats that I’ve never before seen, he has consistently evolved his game to fix the relative weak spots he was previously criticized for. Pretty much all you can ask for from the best ever, no?</figcaption>

                <figcaption>In the realm of table tennis, one name echoes with unparalleled dominance – Ma Long.
                     Widely regarded as the greatest table tennis player ever, Ma Long’s remarkable achievements, including multiple Olympic golds and World Championships. Showcase a level of excellence that transcends eras. 
                     Ma Long used Hurricane 3 to win the 13th National Games, then took two points in the 14th Tokyo World Table Tennis Championships team final. And fulfilled his dream in the 15th Suzhou World Table Tennis Championships men’s singles, 
                     and won the table tennis singles title at this year’s Rio Olympics, earning a career Grand Slam.
                    Sanwei Sports has a great performing rubber that is a level above Hurricane 3 in every way, and that’s the Target National.
                    As the upgraded version of model Target, the Target National is a better choice for 40+ new plastic ball. Thanks to the advanced production technique, covering the unsmooth top sheet with ultrathin sticky rubber film, which helps to keep both high elastic performance and good spin effect.
                    Combining with cake sponge, offering sustained and strong power. The Target National has already been selected by many professional players all over the world.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>Yeah, I get it. He was cantankerous, preening, and almost assuredly a steroid user—not exactly the kind of guy who should get the benefit of the doubt and earn spot number three on this list.
                     Barry Bonds is, in the eyes of many baseball fans, the poster boy for the steroid era and its supposed illegitimacy. But, well, he was already a surefire Hall of Famer before he allegedly began juicing, 
                     and steroids would have had no effect on the unparalleled eye-hand coordination that produced an all-time high 2,558 career walks and staggering .444 lifetime on-base percentage. And that’s the thing about steroids—you can never definitively say exactly what impact they have on a baseball player’s performance. 
                     So let’s just appreciate the incredible statistics Bonds piled up: an unsurpassed 762 home runs (including a single-season record 73 in 2001), a record seven career MVP awards, and 688 intentional walks, which is more than double the amount given to the player with the second most of all time and a striking testament 
                     to the unparalleled fear Bonds instilled in opposing pitchers.</figcaption>
